      <h2>Reception and influence</h2>
      <p>Dostoevsky is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential novelists of the Golden Age of Russian literature.[151] Albert Einstein put him above the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, calling him a "great religious writer" who explores "the mystery of spiritual existence".[152] Friedrich Nietzsche at one point called Dostoevsky "the only psychologist ... from whom I had something to learn; he ranks among the most beautiful strokes of fortune in my life", although the mature Nietzsche later turned against Dostoevsky likening him to Jesus and calling him decadent.[153][154] Hermann Hesse enjoyed Dostoevsky's work and cautioned that to read him is like a "glimpse into the havoc".[155] The Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun wrote that "no one has analyzed the complicated human structure as Dostoyevsky. His psychologic sense is overwhelming and visionary."[156] The Russian literary theorist M.M. Bakhtin's analysis of Dostoevsky came to be at the foundation of his theory of the novel. Bakhtin argued that Dostoevsky's use of multiple voices was a major advancement in the development of the novel as a genre.[150] </p>
      <p>In his posthumous collection of sketches A Moveable Feast, Ernest Hemingway stated that in Dostoevsky "there were things believable and not to be believed, but some so true that they changed you as you read them; frailty and madness, wickedness and saintliness, and the insanity of gambling were there to know".[157] James Joyce praised Dostoevsky's prose: "... he is the man more than any other who has created modern prose, and intensified it to its present-day pitch. It was his explosive power which shattered the Victorian novel with its simpering maidens and ordered commonplaces; books which were without imagination or violence."[158] In her essay The Russian Point of View, Virginia Woolf said, "Out of Shakespeare there is no more exciting reading".[159] Franz Kafka called Dostoevsky his "blood-relative"[160] and was heavily influenced by his works, particularly The Brothers Karamazov and Crime and Punishment, both of which profoundly influenced The Trial.[161] Sigmund Freud called The Brothers Karamazov "the most magnificent novel ever written".[162] Modern cultural movements such as the surrealists, the existentialists and the Beats cite Dostoevsky as an influence,[163] and he is cited as the forerunner of Russian symbolism,[164] existentialism,[165] expressionism[166] and psychoanalysis.[167] </p>
